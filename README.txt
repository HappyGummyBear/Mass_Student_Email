Mass Email Program:

This program is a tool for counselors to mass email students that they have to reach out to with the same information. You will choose an excel file with specific headers for the information needed. The program will read the the file and pick out the columns that have the information it needs to create a student object. Then the user will be able to write out the email they are looking to send. After clicking done they will get a preview of how the email will look. After one more confirmation you hit send and mass email hundreds of students with a click of a button.



Useful Information:
Make sure to go into your email and lower the security which allows programs to use the email.

Make sure when creating the excel file of the students the first row contains these word exactly for the students information:
FistName	LastName	StudentID	QTEmail

Make sure email and password are correct or the program wont be able to access the email to send.

Run through list of students and check for any mistakes.

If email or password are incorrect then the program will show a high error count after hiting send.
